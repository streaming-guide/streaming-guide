# streaming guide

An open project to track *good stuff coverage* for different streaming services.

I'm adding more awards(e.g. Golden Globe, Film Festivals, etc.), lists (e.g. IMDB top 1000), categories (documentary, anime, music, etc.) and more streaming platforms, leave your thoughts.

## data

Checkout the `csv` files in `data` folder.

I'm considering to migrate data to google sheet, or maybe build a tiny API service. I'd love feedbacks.
